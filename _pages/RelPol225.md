# Religion and Politics in American History

## <span style="color:red">This course transitioned to online only in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic. The  original syllabus is available [here.](http://cyrusobrien.com/teaching/relpol225-preCOVID-19) </span>

#### The shift to online classes, and the extension of Spring Break, not only necessitated changes to the course schedule, but also changes to other organizational aspects of the course. I have tried to make it easy to scan this document for such changes by ~~striking out obsolete portions of the syllabus~~ and <span style="color:red">marking new text in red font.</span>

## Course Description

The United States has often been imagined as both a deeply Christian nation and a thoroughly secular republic. These competing visions of the nation have created conflict throughout American history and have made the relationship between religion and politics quite contentious. This course surveys the complex entanglements of religion and public life from the colonial era through the contemporary landscape. Topics covered include: religious liberty and toleration, secularization, the rise of African-American churches, the Civil War, national identity and the Protestant establishment, the religious politics of women's rights, religion and the market, the Cold War, the civil rights movement, the religious left and right, debates over church-state separation, constructions of religious pluralism, and religion after 9/11.

## Assignments and Grading

Your grade will be calculated as follows:

 * ~~30% class participation (this includes blog posts, quizzes, and other forms of participation)~~
 * ~~20% two short essays~~
 * 25% take-home midterm exam
 * 25% take-home final exam
 * <span style="color:red">10% short essay</span>
 * <span style="color:red">20% class participation (pre-COVID-19, including pre-COVID-19 quizzes)</span>
 * <span style="color:red">20% online assignments (group chats, blog posts, online quizzes)<span>

_Note: All assignments must be completed to receive a passing grade in the course._



#### Participation

The most important assignments for this course are to attend class regularly, do the reading, and participate in discussion. Given the importance of in-class discussions, all students are expected to go beyond the role of the “active observer” and merely attending lecture/discussions. Rather, students must work towards critical engagement with their peers and the instructor. Therefore, it is imperative that students complete assigned readings on time and come to class ready to critically engaged the subject matter and share their reflections and insights.



#### #RelPol225

Whether it’s impeachment, Supreme Court cases, or the ongoing election, the themes of this course are often relevant to current events in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. Each student in the course will create an account on Twitter and tweet about current events relating to the course using the hashtag #RelPolt. We will often begin class by discussing the news and our tweets about it. Each student should share at least **5 articles** before the end of the semester. _To receive credit, be sure to post links to your tweets on Canvas in the "Twitter Quiz" section._

<span style="color:red">~~Since we are no longer meeting in person, I ask that you interact with each other and the news on Twitter. Please be sure to comment on at least 3 of your classmates' Twitter posts. I have added Quiz fields on Canvas for you to post links to your replies to your classmates.~~</span> **Forgive me, this was a bad idea. Instead, we'll be talking about the news in our small group chats. Please ignore these earlier instructions.**

#### Blog Posts

Throughout the semester, you will write four blog posts, each due before 9 a.am the day of class. These 250-400 word posts should be written informally. The blog posts are designed to help you prepare for discussion and to provide a forum for you to write . They should include your response to the readings: What do you have questions about? What confused or interested you? How do themes in recent readings relate to topics we studied earlier in the course. Feel free to engage with your classmates, but make sure to root your responses in the reading.

#### Quizzes

Most weeks will entail short quizzes (5-6 minutes) at the beginning of class. These quizzes are graded generously and serve two functions: 1) they help ensure that all participants read the materials before class and 2) they help guide your studying and learning by highlighting the most important questions and themes of the course. The goal setting assignment due through Canvas before the second day of class is assessed as a quiz for grading purposes.

#### Short Essays

~~Two short essays,~~ <span style="color:red">One short essay,</span> between 800-1100 words, will follow units on the Slavery, Abolition, & Confederate Nationalism ~~and on Civil Rights, Struggle, and Retrenchment.~~ Prompts and instructions for ~~these essays~~ <span style="color:red">this essay</span> will be distributed in class.

#### Exams

Take-home midterm and final exams will consist of short answer identification questions that will help you organize and retain the key thematic ideas, three to five slightly longer form questions to be answered in a paragraph, and one (for the midterm) or two (for the final) short essays asking you to synthesize your knowledge. The exams will be based closely on the assigned texts and discussions from class. In addition to review, the best way to prepare for them is to keep up with the reading, actively participate in class discussions, and review the material covered in the quizzes.


#### A Note on the Structure of these Assignments

This course uses frequent, low-stakes assessments (such as quizzes, blog posts, and short essays) for several purposes. One function is that they provide me an opportunity to gauge your learning and comprehension; by the same token, they will also provide you with a sense how you are doing in the class. Another important function is that they provide an opportunity to practice the types of skills you will be asked to demonstrate on exams. Questions on quizzes will resemble the short answers and the blog posts and essays will resemble the essays that are part of the midterm and final exams. It is best to think of the low-stakes assignments as skill-building activities. The assignments in this course are "scaffolded," meaning that they become more difficult over the course of the semester as you develop your skills and deepen your knowledge.

***


## A Community of Practice

Our conversations and discussions will, at times, be difficult. We are tackling problems in liberal democracy that the best minds have failed to solve -- and that equally good minds have worked to exploit. Every one of us has come of age in a world shaped by the topics we are studying in this course. The diversity of our prior experiences will be a great asset, and we will be fortunate to learn from one another. By the same token, difficult and impolitic situations will arise. When they do so, I ask that you approach one another as though we are all participants in a "community of practice." We are learning from one another, and your goal in interacting with your peers are to learn from and _teach_ one another. Focusing on teaching -- on bringing someone along -- is especially important because it helps maintain our community and the atmosphere for social learning. My goal -- and I ask that you share it -- is to leave people better than you found them.

***



## Readings
 All articles, book chapters, and documents listed in the syllabus will be available electronically, either as pdf files on Canvas or as online links in the syllabus.

***


## Technology in the Classroom
 Laptops or tablets will serve useful purposes in this course, including bringing up digital copies of readings and documents during discussion. For some in-class exercises, it will be essential for at least some members of the class to have access to online databases archives and to the Canvas site. Laptops/tablets should be closed during the class segments when they are not necessary. Using technology for non-class related purposes is not allowed and is both disrespectful and distracting to your classmates. The research on the negative effects of online multi-tasking during class is unambiguous. Cell phones should be turned off or muted during class and should not be in sight at any time. Please follow these guidelines so that we can utilize technology productively in the classroom, rather than adopt the zero-tolerance policy of many university courses.

## Style and Citation Guide

You should write papers in a double-spaced, reader-friendly, size 12 font and use normal (1 or 1.5 inch) margins. Proper citation of all sources is expected. Please consult the [_Chicago Manual of Style_](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html).

#### <span style="color:red">At this point in the semester, the course is shifting to online only.</span>

<span style="color:maroon">The format of the online course will primarily be asynchronous. Most weeks, you will write a short, informal blog posts on Canvas of about 200 words about a subset of the week's readings. (This is slightly shorter than the blog posts you wrote earlier in the course.) Emily and I will comment on your posts.

<span style="color:maroon">Each week will also feature "chats" in your small groups. The model for this are fivethirtyeight.com's Chats, [which you can review here if you're interested.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/)</span>

<span style="color:maroon"> **This will entail synchronous activities with the members of your small group. If someone from your group is unable to participate, please just note that at the beginning of the conversation.** Also, do your best to preserve a record of who said what. Take a look at the fivethirtyeight model to get a sense of what we're shooting for.</span>

<span style="color:maroon">I suggest that you chat during what used to be our class time, namely from 1-2pm CDT. However, if you want to collectively schedule another time that works for all the members of your small group, that is fine, too. These groups will have the same composition of the small discussion groups we frequently used when we met IRL.</span>


<span style="color:maroon">I have a few goals in preserving the small groups. First, I hope it offers some continuity as we shift to online learning. Second, I hope that the groups retain their efficacy; I was impressed with how well you tackled the course content in your small group discussions, and I hope you can can continue in that productive vein. Finally, I hope that chatting in the small groups will provide some sense of community during these very unusual times. Many of us are likely to feel isolated and trapped, and I invite you to use the small group chat forums to connect with one another.

<span style="color:maroon">I know that this goes without saying, but please make sure to be considerate of your peers. Many of us (myself included) are worried about family who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and, according to a recent poll, one in five American households now has someone out of work due to the pandemic. In such stressful times, it's especially important to be compassionate towards one another.</span>

<span style="color:maroon">I have set up forums for your small groups on Canvas, in the "Collaborations" tab. When you click on it, you'll find a GoogleDoc that you share with the other members of your group. **I expect Google Docs to be a bit of a clunky platform, and I invite you to use whatever platform is best, so long as you can paste your transcipt into Google Docs so Emily and I can review your chats.** Personally, I think chatting inside Google Hangouts may best, though Slack and old fashioned text messaging also promise to be effective. You're also welcome to conduct a conference call or video call with your small group, so long as you rotate taking notes and making those notes available to me and Emily by the end of the day on Friday.</span>

<span style="color:maroon">**I ask that you conclude each chat session by attempting to articulate a "So What?!" statement or two, and by creating a short list of key terms that could be used for the final exam.** Using online chat functions is slower than talking face-to-face, so I expect your small group chats to take an hour or so.</span>

<span style="color:maroon">I will circulate discussion questions to guide your chats on Thursdays by 10am CDT.</span>

#### Cold War Religion and Anti-Communism

The thing to take away from it for this course is that the Cold War was no joke: People who occupied positions of leadership in the U.S. military were more than ready to begin a nuclear World War III that would resulted in hundreds of millions of deaths. It's not exactly comforting reading in the era of coronavirus, but it's a great article._
