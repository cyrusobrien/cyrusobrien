# Criminal and Juvenile Justice Activism

I am a prison abolitionist. I have been working to reduce and limit incarceration since 2008, when I moved to Alabama to work for juvenile justice reform. I've worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the American Bar Association, and, since 2013, the Project on Accountable Justice, a criminal justice reform think-tank based at Florida State University. My projects to reduce incarceration have involved legislative advocacy, collaborative technical assistance to local courts and state corrections agencies, media campaigns, and assistance with litigation against a private juvenile prison. Some of this work has resulted in publications, a selection of which is below.

                       <p>I lead a research team that analyzed quantitative data from multiple sources to find out what happened to children after they were transferred to adult court and prosecuted as adults. We found that 72% of children prosecuted as adults were <b>not</b> initially sentenced to prison, but instead were offered plea agreements to probation. The processes that allowed children to be prosecuted as adults produced significant racial disparities, violated basic norms of fairness, and resulted from an extreme concentration of power in the hands of prosecutors.<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/2016-juvenile-justice-policy-brief-21.pdf"> Available as a PDF here...</a></p>

                     <p>This guide, to a process known as "community asset-mapping," rejects the habit of describing communities in which many of our children live by listing their problems. Instead of focusing on deficits, asset-mapping spotlights methods of tapping into the hidden wealth of knowledge in all communities for the benefit of children.

                        <p>This white paper was based on a quantitative analysis of youth incarceration in Florida that found that nearly half of all children admitted to juvenile prisons were adjudicated only for a misdemeanor or probation violation. It was the <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/PublishedContent/Session/2012/InterimReports/2012-118cj.pdf">basis</a> for <a href="http://laws.flrules.org/2011/54" > legislation</a> that prohibited the incarceration of children adjudicated for misdemeanors in most circumstances, the implementation of which has contributed to a nearly 70% decline in juvenile incarceration in the state. Jointly published by the Southern Poverty Law Center and Florida TaxWatch, it was one of the first (and remains one of the few) successful anti-incarceration collaborations between right and left. I wasn't responsible for the title...
