# Digital History and Data Visualization

I'm interested in telling stories in multiple ways. At the encouragement of [Justin Jocque](http://justinjoque.com/), the Visualization Librarian at the [University of Michigan Library](https://www.lib.umich.edu/data-visualization), I learned [D3 (for Data-Driven Documents), the Javascript library](https://d3js.org/) created by Mike Bostock, formerly of the New York Times.

The projects below use digital and computational methods to convey the growth of U.S. prison systems since 1970, racial disparities in Florida's criminal justice system, and the contradictory criminal justice policies that the Florida Legislature has enacted since 1970.

                        <p>Mass incarceration is often depicted graphically with one of the ubiquitous "hockey stick" charts that show the exponential growth of U.S. prisons since the early 1970s.

                        <p>Racial and jurisdictional disparities are defining characteristics of America's criminal justice systems. Where you live and the color of your skin can have a far greater impact on your odds of being incarcerated than what you do.</p>
                         <p>Disparities are largest at the "lower ends" of the justice system where officials have more discretion. This is especially true regarding imprisonment for drugs. This data visualization shows racial and jurisdictional disparities. <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/racialdisparities"> Read more and see the interactive visualization...</a></p>

                        <p>One of my most puzzling moments in the archives was learning about a 1983 law that placed a ceiling on Florida's prison population of 275 prisoners per 100,000 residents. The very same year that the legislature sought to cap prison growth, it also abolished parole--one of the more consequential setps on the path to mass incarceration. This animated timeline highlights the policies that contributed to mass incarceration, while also pointing out the half-steps that might have prevented it.<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/animatedtimeline.html"> Read more and see the interactive visualization...</a></p>
