# Data Visualizations

I'm interested in telling stories in multiple ways. At the encouragement of Justin Jocque, the Visualization Librarian the the University of Michigan, I recently began learning [D3 (for Data-Driven Documents), the Javascript library](https://d3js.org/) created by Mike Bostock, formerly of the New York Times.

Below are links to a few of the more interesting and revealing visualizations I've created. These are part of a forth-coming report by the Project on Accountable Justice. Stay tuned for updates.

                        <p>Mass incarceration is often depicted graphically with one of the ubiquitous "hockey stick" charts that show the exponential growth of U.S. prisons since the early 1970s. This Demers Cartogram shows the growth of U.S. prison populations while highlighting regional differences. <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/cartogram"> Read more and see the interactive visualization...</a></p>

                        <p>Racial and jurisdictional disparities are defining characteristics of America's criminal justice systems. Where you live and the color of your skin can have a far greater impact on your odds of being incarcerated than what you do.</p>
                         <p>Disparities are largest at the "lower ends" of the justice system where officials have more discretion. This is especially true regarding imprisonment for drugs. This data visualization shows racial and jurisdictional disparities. <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/racialdisparities"> Read more and see the interactive visualization...</a></p>
