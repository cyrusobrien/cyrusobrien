I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Danforth Center for Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis](http://rap.wustl.edu/bio/cyrus-obrien/). I earned a PhD in Anthropology and History at the University of Michigan in 2018, where my dissertation won the [ProQuest Distinguished Dissertation Award](https://rackham.umich.edu/faculty-and-staff/awards/distinguished-dissertation-awards/). My research focuses on racial inequality, religion, and institutions in the United States.

I am currently working on a manuscript titled _Faith in Imprisonment: Religion and the Development of Mass Incarceration in Florida_. This work places religion at the center of the study of mass incarceration in the United States. In particular, it shows how religious ideas and organizations shaped the development, structure, and experiences of mass incarceration in the latter half of the twentieth century. I develop this argument by tracing religion’s changing roles as Florida’s prison system expanded from an archipelago of small labor camps at the outset of the Second World War into one of the world’s largest justice systems. Blending archival research with data I collected through hundreds of hours of ethnography in a North Florida prison and more than one hundred oral history and ethnographic interviews, I demonstrate that religion was a key force in the adoption of parole, the embrace of halfway houses, and the privatization of prisons -— fundamental transformations that expanded the criminal justice system’s capacities to supervise and to incarcerate, drawing its tentacles deeper into daily American life.

My work has been supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsfgrfp.org), the [Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research](http://www.wennergren.org/grantees/obrien-cyrus-james), the [Rackham Graduate School at the University of Michigan](https://www.rackham.umich.edu/blog/announcing-2016-2017-rackham-predoctoral-fellowship-winners), the [Anti-Discrimination Center](http://www.antibiaslaw.com/) and the [Charlotte Newcombe Foundation](http://woodrow.org/news/2017-newcombe-fellows-named/).
