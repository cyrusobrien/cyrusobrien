I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Danforth Center for Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis](http://rap.wustl.edu/bio/cyrus-obrien/). I completed my PhD in Anthropology and History at the University of Michigan in 2018. My research focuses on racial inequality, religion, and institutions in the United States.

My research places religion at the center of the study of mass incarceration in the United States. My work shows how religious ideas and organizations  shaped the development, structure, and experiences of mass incarceration in the latter half of the twentieth century. I develop this argument by tracing religion’s changing roles as Florida’s prison system expanded from an archipelago of small labor camps at the outset of the Second World War into one of the world’s largest justice systems. Blending archival research with data I collected through hundreds of hours of ethnography in a Florida prison and more than one hundred oral history and ethnographic interviews, I demonstrate that religion was a key force in the adoption of parole, the embrace of halfway houses, and the privatization of prisons -— fundamental transformations that expanded the criminal justice system’s capacities to supervise and to incarcerate, drawing its tentacles deeper into daily American life.
