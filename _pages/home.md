I am a PhD Candidate in Anthropology and History at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on racial inequality, religion, and institutions in the United States. I defend my dissertation, _Faith in Imprisonment: Religion and the Development of Mass Incarceration in Florida_ in May 2018.

My research asks how and why the United States became the world’s largest jailer. Complementing and integrating scholarship focusing on the role of racism in building mass incarceration, _Faith in Imprisonment_ argues that religious ideas and organizations profoundly contributed to the development, structure, and experiences of mass incarceration in the latter half of the twentieth century. It develops this thesis by tracing religion’s changing roles as Florida’s criminal justice system expanded from an archipelago of small labor camps at the outset of the Second World War into one of the largest justice systems in the world.
