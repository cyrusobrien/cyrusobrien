 I am a PhD Candidate in Anthropology and History at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on racial inequality, religion, and institutions in the United States. In May 2018, I defend my dissertation, _Faith in Imprisonment: Religion and the Development of Mass Incarceration in Florida_.

 My research asks how and why the United States became the world’s largest jailer. Where existing scholarship about mass incarceration primarily focuses on race (and, to a lesser extent, class and gender), _Faith in Imprisonment_ argues that religious ideas and organizations profoundly contributed to the development, structure, and experiences of mass incarceration in the latter half of the twentieth century. It develops this thesis by tracing religion’s changing roles as Florida’s criminal justice system expanded from an archipelago of small labor camps at the outset of the Second World War into one of the largest justice systems in the world. The dissertation is anchored in an analysis of the internal archives of the Florida Department of Corrections and Florida Parole Commission; thirteen months of ethnographic fieldwork in a state prison; and the archives of ancillary institutions—probation offices, halfway houses, churches, and private religious organizations. The dissertation demonstrates that punitive measures alone do not explain mass incarceration. Rather, rehabilitative, anti-institutional reforms promoted by religious groups and rooted Christian ideologies also played instrumental roles. Religion emerges as a key force behind the adoption of parole, the embrace of halfway houses, and the inception of privately operated prisons. These were fundamental transformations that, often inadvertently, expanded the criminal justice system’s capacity to incarcerate and drew its tentacles deeper into the fabric of daily American life.
