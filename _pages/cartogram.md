# Demers Cartogram Showing State Imprisonment

<iframe src="https://accountablejustice.github.io/report/DataVisualizations/cgram2015.html" height='600' width='960' frameborder='0' scrolling='no'></iframe>

This visualization shows state imprisonment numbers and rates. By clicking on any state, you will see the growth of incarceration since 1970. One of the things I like most about this visualization is that the expansion of each state's prison population distorts the shape and integrity of the nation as a whole.

Thanks to Chris Givens, whose D3 visualization I modified to make this.
