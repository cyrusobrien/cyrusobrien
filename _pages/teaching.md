# Teaching

My efforts to connect abstract social forces to individualsâ€™ everyday experiences extend to my teaching, where I use project-based learning to bring real-world controversies into the course in structured ways. In courses I've taught and developed, students visit courts, prisons, places of worship, and local archives to see how the phenomena we are studying work out in the lives of real people. I also incorporate diverse perspectives into my teaching that draw on my research and social justice work: "Incarceration Nation," a first-year writing course I designed, includes Skype interactions with a civil rights attorney and a former corrections official. The pedagogical goal of these discussions is to expose students to the ways the debates and histories we are studying in the course are also being worked through by practitioners --- often in complex and messy ways.

I am currently teaching a course called "Religion and Politics in American History." You can access the syllabus [here.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/relpol225)

In the Fall of 2018, I taught The Politics of Religion, Crime, and Punishment in the United States. You can access the syllabus [here.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/RelPolt275)
