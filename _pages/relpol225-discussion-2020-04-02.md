## Discussion for April 2, 2020

Thank you all for your continued willingness to experiment with “alternative” modes of learning.

Overall, your chats were fantastic. Almost every group did a great job of working through the material and the answers you came to are good ones.

That being said, a couple of groups could benefit from a bit more exchange and dialogue. Rather than each student doing their best to answer the question as comprehensively as possible, the best chats chipped away at the questions. Often the first response to the question was a brief, solid building block—more a place to begin the conversation than a place to end. The best chats regularly contained phrases like, “Yeah, I agree.” “Right!” “Exactly!” “It makes me think about ______.” and “I’m not sure what to think about this article/question.” In general, the groups that began to tackle each question with shorter answers got

The readings from this week build on last week’s exploration of the Cold War. You all did a great job identifying the main thrusts from last week. 1) That, during the Cold War, “religion” became central to understandings of national identity and that this idea was advanced through massive (public and private) investments in religious life. 2) That the idea of a Christian nation was an especially potent contrast to the Soviet Union, which had a religious propaganda campaign of its own. Though these campaigns had opposing goals—the USSR delegitimized religion and promoted atheism while the US did the opposite—they shared some similarities, too. 3) Powerful figures such as J. Edgar Hoover and President Eisenhower promoted the idea of the US as a religious nation, though there were some differences that are worth pointing out. Hoover especially promoted “Christian renewal” while, as many of you noticed, Eisenhower did more to promote religion in general (as opposed to specifically Christian).


### Discussion Questions
1. Again, take time (if you feel like it) to check in with one another. If you’re worried about yourself or a classmate, please email me and I’ll do what I can to help.
2. Take a few minutes to check out #relpol225. It’s a lot about religion and coronavirus….
3. What did J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI find threatening about Martin Luther King, Jr.?
4. On the other hand, what Hoover and the FBI like about the Elder Lightfoot Solomon Michaux? (You should just call him “Michaux,” which he pronounced “mee-SHAW.”) Why didn’t the FBI find Michaux to be threatening? What did Michaux think about racial hierarchy?
5. What was it about the _religion_ of Michaux vs. King that made one the nation’s “most dangerous Negro” and the other an asset of the FBI? What was it about the _politics_ of the two (especially the racial politics? Thinking about Annette Gordon-Reed’s essay, in what ways were the _politics_ and _religion_ of King (and Michaux) intertwined? Can we talk about politics without talking about religion in the case of these two?
6. How did the FBI seek to “neutralize” King? What roles did Michaux play in these activities? Why did the FBI believe that Michaux was an effective counterweight to King? What Cold War narrative about America as a nation was he especially well-situated to espouse?
7. How did the Spiritual-Industrial Complex fuel the rise of Michaux? Was Michaux _part_ of the Spiritual-Industrial Complex?
8. What did the FBI, Hoover, and Michaux think it meant to be “American?” Why didn’t Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the most acclaimed and celebrated Americans ever, not fit into their image?
9. So what?!?! Also, please list a few key terms for the final.
