## Course Description


This course traces the relationship between religion and the politics of crime and punishment in the United States from the Colonial and Revolutionary Eras to the Trump Administration. We ask how religious movements and religious ideas shaped the establishment of penitentiaries, the structures of modern policing, and the prisoners’ rights movement. We also explore how religion shaped the priorities of the FBI, contemporary movements for prison reform, and the contours of American debates about immigration and the War on Terror. The course highlights the unintended consequences of efforts to reform and rehabilitate and emphasizes religion’s interconnections to race and citizenship. Students will leave the course with an understanding of how American religious traditions and movements from Quakers and followers of the Social Gospel to the Nation of Islam and evangelical Christianity have continually reshaped the politics of crime and punishment in America.

#### Participation

The most important assignments for this course are to attend class regularly, do the reading, and participate in discussion. Given the importance of in-class discussions, all students are expected to go beyond the role of the “active observer” and merely attending lecture/discussions. Rather, students must work towards critical engagement with their peers and the instructor. Therefore, it is imperative that students complete assigned readings on time and come to class ready to critically engaged the subject matter and share their reflections and insights.

<div class="col-sm-6" markdown="1">

#### #RelPolt

Whether it’s the Trump Administration’s travel ban or churches trying to shield people from deportation, the themes of this course are often relevant to current events in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. Each student in the course will create an account on Twitter and tweet about current events relating to the course using the hashtag #RelPolt. We will often begin class by discussing the news and our tweets about it. Each student should share at least **5 articles** before the end of the semester.

#### Blog Posts

Throughout the semester, you will write four blog posts, each due before the start of class. These 250-400 word posts should be written informally and posts are due by the start of the relevant class or section meeting. The blog posts are designed to help you prepare for discussion and to provide a forum for you to write informally. They should include your response to the readings: What do you have questions about? What confused or interested you? How do themes in recent readings relate to topics we studied earlier in the course.

#### Quizzes

Weeks without other assignments will entail short quizzes (5-6 minutes) at the beginning of class. These quizzes are graded generously and serve two functions: 1) they help ensure that all participants read the materials before class and 2) they help guide your studying and learning by highlighting the most important questions and themes of the course. The goal setting assignment due through Canvas before the second day of class is assessed as a quiz for grading purposes.

#### Short Essays

Two short essays, between 800-1100 words, will follow units on the Disciplinary Prison and on the Policing of Religious and Racial Pluralism during the Cold War. Prompts and instructions for these essays will be distributed in class.

#### Exams

Take-home midterm and final exams will consist of short answer identification questions that will help you organize and retain the key thematic ideas, three to five slightly longer form questions to be answered in a paragraph, and one (for the midterm) or two (for the final) short essays asking you to synthesize your knowledge. The exams will be based closely on the assigned texts and discussions from class. In addition to review, the best way to prepare for them is to keep up with the reading, actively participate in class discussions, and review the material covered in the quizzes.

#### A Note on the Structure of these Assignments

This course uses frequent, low-stakes assessments (such as quizzes, blog posts, and short essays) for several purposes. One function is that they provide me an opportunity to gauge your learning and comprehension; by the same token, they will also provide you with a sense how you are doing in the class. Another important function is that they provide an opportunity to practice the types of skills you will be asked to demonstrate on exams. Questions on quizzes will resemble the short answers and the blog posts and essays will resemble the essays that are part of the midterm and final exams. It is best to think of the low-stakes assignments as skill-building activities. The assignments in this course are "scaffolded," meaning that they become more difficult over the course of the semester as you develop your skills and deepen your knowledge.

## Readings
 All articles, book chapters, and documents listed in the syllabus will be available electronically, either as pdf files on Canvas or as online links in the syllabus.

***


## Technology in the Classroom
 Laptops or tablets will serve useful purposes in this course, including bringing up digital copies of readings and documents during discussion. For some in- class exercises, it will be essential for at least some members of the class to have access to online databases archives and to the Canvas site. Laptops/tablets should be closed during the class segments when they are not necessary. Using technology for non-class related purposes is not allowed and is both disrespectful and distracting to your classmates. The research on the negative effects of online multi-tasking during class is unambiguous. Cell phones should be turned off or muted during class and should not be in sight at any time. Please follow these guidelines so that we can utilize technology productively in the classroom, rather than adopt the zero-tolerance policy of many university courses.

***

## Style and Citation Guide

You should write papers in a double-spaced, reader-friendly, size 12 font and use normal (1 or 1.5 inch) margins. Proper citation of all sources is expected. Please use the _Chicago Manual of Style_ or follow the guide written by Steve Volk, available [here](http://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/svolk/citation.htm).
