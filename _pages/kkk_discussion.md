1.	What was "Americanism" for the KKK?

2. How did women figure on the KKK's model of nationalism?

3. How did KKK leaders appropriate figures from American History? Was this surprising to you? How did this appropriation shape collective memories?

4. Why did the KKK support "a common school education?"

5. Which groups did the KKK see as its antagonists? Why?

6. How did the KKK's ideas about Americanism echo or clash with other conceptions of American-ness that we've read in class? (Think about Nicolle Hannah-Jones, the Inauguration of the Jackson Statute, Frederick Douglass, Ronald Reagan, and readings from our Empire unit.)

7. Baker ends her book pondering the legacy of the 1920s KKK, and, in the end, decides to break down the KKK's legacy along several axes. What do you make of her attempt to associate *strands* of contemporary (for 2010) political movements with the KKK?
