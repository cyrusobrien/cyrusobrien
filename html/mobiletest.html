<p>_Faith in Imprisonment_, my first book project, uses religion as a lens to examine the development of mass incarceration. Where existing scholarship about mass incarceration primarily focuses on race (and, to a lesser extent, class and gender), I show that religious ideas and organizations also profoundly shaped the development, structure, and experiences of incarceration in the latter half of the twentieth century. My scholarship draws on conducted archival research in the internal records of the Florida Department of Corrections and the Florida Parole Commission and  thirteen months of ethnographic research in a state prison. Religion emerges as a key force in the adoption of parole, the embrace of halfway houses, and the inception of private prisons—fundamental transformations that expanded the criminal justice system’s capacity to supervise and incarcerate and drew its tentacles deeper into the fabric of daily American life. The two key contributions of the book as a whole are to emphasize the religiously-mediated connections between prisons and other social sites, and to demonstrate that mass incarceration depended on reforms—often promoted by religious organizations or motivated by religious ideologies—that grew and legitimated the carceral mechanisms of the U. S. state.</p>
